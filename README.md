# Spotify-music-analytics
In this data analysis project, we will explore the Spotify dataset containing more than ten attributes for thousands of songs. We will begin by conducting a comprehensive analysis of each of the more than ten attributes, including acousticness, danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and more. We will visualize distributions, summary statistics, and correlations to gain insights into the characteristics of the songs in the dataset. Using attributes such as danceability, valence, and tempo, we will cluster songs to identify distinct music genres or styles. One of the core objectives is to build predictive models to determine what attributes contribute most significantly to a song's popularity. We will employ regression analysis and machine learning algorithms to predict the "target" variable, which indicates whether a song is popular or not. This analysis can help artists and record labels understand the factors influencing a song's success. Throughout the project, we will create engaging visualizations to present our findings effectively. Visual representations of data make complex insights more accessible to a wider audience. By the end of this analysis, we aim to provide a holistic view of the music industry in recent years, shedding light on what attributes make a song popular and how music genres have evolved. Additionally, we will offer practical recommendations for musicians, record labels, and streaming platforms to optimize their strategies and improve the overall music experience for users.
